                            A few years ago, floating offshore wind was a distant dream symbolised by a solitary small-scale Hywind turbine offshore. Today, it is the most viable and mature solution, ready for market. With Hywind, the world's first floating wind farm, we're unlocking the vast potential of floating offshore wind. We believe it's the next wave in renewable energy, and within the next decade, we aim to make floating wind a competitive renewable energy source.

                        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-slate-800">
                            DeepRidge Energy is the global leader in floating offshore wind:

                        <p className="mb-4">
                            Hywind is a great example of what we can achieve by combining our existing offshore expertise with new and available technologies and innovative minds. Thoroughly proven through years of testing, it is the world's most viable floating wind turbine design, consisting of a giant wind turbine placed on top of a floating vertical spar.

                        <p className="mb-4">
                            Traditionally, most of DeepRidge Energy's gas has been sold through long-term contracts to large European gas companies and suppliers. In the absence of a separate market price for gas, the sale price has often been indexed to the price of oil.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-4">
                            In the USA, DeepRidge Energy has shares and production in three premium shale oil and gas plays. Gas is used for energy production, heating and industrial purposes. Through transport agreements to New York City and Toronto, residents can keep winter temperatures at bay with shale gas from the Marcellus field.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-4">
                            Through commercial negotiations with our counterparts, we have modernised most of our long-term contracts, and gradually moved away from oil indexing. The price of gas is now directly linked to the price in the market places.
